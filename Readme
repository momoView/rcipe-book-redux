I used Firebase for authentication and as a back end. 
I used also @ngrx's Redux directly from the start without developing services.

In the start the user is disconnected, so you cannot interact with the different features of the application, you need first
to register a user then login (register & login links in header (user password should be at least 6 characters)) then you
will be able to use all the features of the application (Manage -> Save/Fetch data serve to save or fetch data from Firebase).
